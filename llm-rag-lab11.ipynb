The make-up cannot be rescheduled. \\n \\n \\nPREPARING FOR FIRST DAY OF IN-PERSON LAB \\n \\nPROPER LABORATORY ATTIRE: The clothing you wear to lab must provide skin protection from chemical spills \\nand splashes.  Ankles and feet must be completely covered . Please refer to the LABORATORY SAFETY \\nREQUIREMENTS on page 11 for a more detailed discussion. \\nLAB COATS: Each student is required to purchase a lab coat to wea r during General Chemistry labs.  We \\nrecommend purchasing your lab coat from the Chemistry store to wear during General Chemistry labs as they have \\nbeen specially selected to protect you from the hazards in the lab. For our general chemistry lab, lab coats should \\ncover the wearer to near the knees. They must be made of a polyester -cotton blend with no less than 35% cotton.  \\nPlease come prepared with a lab coat for your first in-person lab, otherwise you will unfortunately be sent home from \\nlab. Therefore, please give yourself plenty of time to purchase a lab coat before your first lab session.  \\n \\nLab Coat Purchase : The Chemistry Store ( https://u.osu.edu/chems/) is located in 180 Celeste Lab and is open \\nMonday-Friday (closed on university holidays). Their hours vary during the semester, make sure to check their website \\nto get info on the hours of operation. The Chemistry Store is a university -run store and is not affiliated with the \\nDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry.    Credit cards, Apple Pay and Buck -ID are currently the only accepted \\nmethods of payment at the Chemistry Store. You must have your lab coat by your first in- person lab session. When \\nyou purchase your lab coat at the Chemistry Store, you will be provided with a plastic zip- top bag for storage and a \\nlab coat care sheet. If you are re-taking General Chemistry, you will be provided with a bag in your first lab session.  \\n                                               AUTUMN 2025  \\n6 \\n \\n \\nYou will keep your lab coat and goggles between lab sessions. Your TA will walk you through the lab coat protocol \\nduring your first laboratory session. At the end of the course, you will keep your lab coat for future lab experiences. \\n \\nLab Coat Etiquette: Lab coats should be fully buttoned up when in the laboratory. We are not able to loan lab coats \\nto students if you forget your own lab coat. You should remove your lab coat before heading home, or to the bathroom \\nor drinking fountain. You may wear your lab coat when obtaining items from the stockroom window. You are not \\npermitted to sit on the benches in the hallway while wearing your lab coat. Never wear your lab coat at home.   Always \\ntreat your lab coat as if it is contaminated. \\nGOGGLES: Each student in Chemistry 1210 will be provided with goggles for use in the General Chemistry \\nlaboratory during their first in-person lab session. \\n \\nLABORATORY ASSIGNMENTS & GRADING \\n \\nLAB POINT DISTRIBUTION : The laboratory component of CHEM 12 10 is worth 20% of your overall course \\ngrade. Therefore, your total points earned (out of the total 1100) will be scaled to contribute this percentage to your \\noverall course grade. For more information, see your lecture syllabus or Carmen gradebook. To ensure you develop \\nthe necessary skills and competencies critical for your success in chemistry, you will need to earn 50% of the total \\nlab points (550/1100) to pass the course. Regardless of your grades in lecture, if you do not meet this minimum, \\nunfortunately you will be assigned an “E” grade in CHEM 1210. \\nPoint Distribution for Each Lab \\nAbbreviation   Activity   LabRight \\nPre-Lab   Notebook  \\nLabRight \\nPost-\\nLab   \\nTotal   \\nCheck-In/WRM*  Introduction to the General Chemistry Laboratory   –  5  55  60  \\nCPC Chemical and Physical Changes     15  15  70  100  \\nMSR** Volumetric Glassware & Density   15  15  70  100  \\nPbI** Synthesis and Characterization of Lead Iodide     15  15  70  100  \\nCYC Investigation of a Copper Cycle   15  15  70  100  \\nLLT** Quantitative Analysis of the Citric Acid Content in \\nJuices  15  15  70  100  \\nIHT** Investigating Heat Transfer and Calorimetry   15  15  70  100  \\nEMS† Emission of Light and Atomic Models   15    85  100  \\nQUL Qualitative Determination of Selected Metal \\nCations   15  15  70  100  \\nMGB Molecular Geometry, Bonding, and Polarity   15    85 100  \\nGAS** Exploring the Gas Laws with Alka-Seltzer®   15 15 80  100  \\n– End of Semester Surveys  –   –    –  40 \\nOverall Lab Total:   1100   \\n \\n*Students who attend lab in person do not complete a Post-Lab for Check-In and will receive 55 points for lab participation. \\n**This experiment has a Data Analysis Worksheet; the score is included in the Post -lab assignment on LabRight. \\n                                                                                                                                †This experiment does not have a notebook assignment. \\n  \\nGRADING REVIEW REQUESTS : We are happy to review the grading of your lab assignments, if necessary. \\nHowever, please note that all requests for re-grading (Pre-Labs, Notebook, Post-Labs, etc.) should be made within 1 \\nweek of receipt of the graded work. You are required to discuss the grade with your TA first before contacting the lab \\nsupervisors to request for re -grade. After receiving your request via email, the lab supervisors will first discuss the \\ngrading process with your TA and then one of the Lab supervisors will re -grade the entire assignment. This revised \\ngrade will then be final.   \\nDATA INTEGRITY: Data integrity is critical to your success in chemistry. Thus, it is important to remember that \\ndata and procedural information in your lab notebook cannot be altered in any way after you have left the lab. The  \\n                                               AUTUMN 2025  \\n7 \\n \\ndata and written procedures recorded in your LabRight Post-Lab assignment (see below) should match the data and \\nprocedures in your lab notebook, so we encourage students to be careful when copying procedure or data from your \\nnotebook to your LabRight Post-Lab assignment. Changing data or adding detail to a written procedure in a LabRight \\nPost-Lab assignment is considered data fabrication. Common examples of data fabrication include adding zeros to \\nvalues, changing exact values or observations, or adding details to procedures. For more information, review the “A \\nNote About Data Integrity” page on Carmen and the “Standards of Academic Conduct in General Chemistry” below. \\nLATE SUBMISSIONS: All assignments are due by the date and time listed on Carmen.  Pre-Lab assignments \\nclose at the start of the lab time  and no late assignments will be accepted or graded. Notebook Uploads submitted \\nafter 48 hours from the start of the lab time will earn points deductions. \\nAll LabRight Post-Labs will remain open for three (3) days past the due date listed in Carmen.  There will be a 20 % \\ndeduction per day for Post-Labs that are fully submitted once the due date passes. After the 3-day period has passed, \\nsubmissions will no longer be accepted. Students are strongly encouraged to work ahead on the LabRight Post-Lab \\nassignment so they can contact the lab supervisors before the due date if they encounter issues while working on the \\nassignments. This ensures that there is enough time to provide any assistance needed. The lab supervisors may not \\nbe able to help in a timely manner if a student contacts them once the due date of the assignment has passed. The \\ntimestamp on your submission in LabRight is the official submission time and date.  \\nStudents who miss the deadlines due to extenuating circumstances are required to reach out to the lab supervisors \\nwithin 24 hours of the missed assignments. The lab supervisors will review your circumstances and make a decision \\nas to whether you will receive an exception to the submission deadline. Regardless of individual assignment due \\ndates, no Pre-Labs, Post-Labs or notebook uploads will be accepted after 11:59 PM on Tuesday, December 9th   \\n2025.  \\nLABORATORY ASSIGNMENT TYPES \\n \\nLab supervisors will provide information about each lab assignment in multiple ways.  The information may be provided \\nin this lab syllabus, via email, or on Carmen. On Carmen, this can include posted announcements, the overview page \\nin your laboratory module for each experiment, the instruction box for each assignment , and in some cases, \\ninformation embedded in the question itself.  \\nPRE-LAB ASSIGNMENTS: To ensure that you are well-prepared to conduct experiments each week, Pre-Labs \\nneed to be completed before the start time of your lab. Pre-Labs are available on LabRight and can only be accessed \\nthrough Carmen. We highly encourage you to read all Pre-Lab instructions carefully before you start the assignment. \\nOnly have the Pre-Lab open when you are working on it. If the Pre-Lab has been idle for more than an hour, quit and \\nsave your work, and re-open the link from Carmen. Working on more than one Pre-Lab at a time, or opening multiple \\nPre-Labs in multiple tabs or browsers simultaneously is not allowed and may result in loss of submitted information or \\nother errors with the program. \\n \\nYou can only submit each Pre-Lab once; they cannot be reset for any reason. However, you can attempt each Pre-\\nLab question twice. After answering a Pre-Lab question, you may click on the \"How Did I Do?\" button at the top of the \\nquestion to see which answers are incorrect. You can then review the relevant topics and revise your response(s). \\nYour response(s) will not be graded until you submit the completed Pre- Lab by clicking the \"Submit Assignment\" \\nbutton. \\n \\nUnfortunately, no credit (0) will be given if the Pre-Lab assignment is late. The assignment closes at the start of the \\nlab time. Please note that students cannot be excused from Pre- Labs of experiments that have been assigned to \\nthem. \\nLABORATORY NOTEBOOK: The laboratory notebook is a permanent record of purpose, reference source of \\nyour procedures, observations, data, and conclusions. As one of our Learning Outcomes, it is important to learn how \\nto create and keep a lab notebook as a General Chemistry student and scientist. You may use the paper copy of the \\nnotebook pages provided for each experiment or use a downloaded copy in Notability (or a similar app) on a device \\nthat has a digital note-taking capability (such as an iPad, tablet or 2-in-1 laptop/tablet). Please note that laptops cannot \\nbe used as lab notebooks. Please also note that no information can be recorded on scratch paper or in other parts of \\nthe lab manual during an in- person laboratory session. It is critical to ensure that all information recorded in a lab   \\n                                               AUTUMN 2025  \\n8 \\n \\nnotebook, whether on paper or digitally recorded, is not altered in any way after leaving the lab.  \\n \\nTo ensure a productive in-person lab experience, some part of your notebook should be prepared before the beginning \\nof lab, and you will earn up to 15 points for a well-prepared notebook that has all components. The notebook template   \\nhas spaces for purpose and procedure. You are expected to add a purpose and summary of procedure in the spaces \\nprovided before coming to lab. You will go over how to prepare your lab notebook during the first day of lab. During \\ngrading, your TA will assess your notebook prep and its contents and then assign you notebook points. Please note \\nthat points will be deducted for missing components. Having a fully prepared notebook will ensure you understand lab \\nprocedures, what data is to be collected in the lab, and any relevant safety concerns.  \\n \\nThere are some experiments that require you to complete some in-lab activities in addition to collecting data prior to \\nleaving lab. These activities have been designed to provide some conceptual insight into what the experiment is about \\nand to encourage discussions among students and with the lab TA. T he In-Lab activities have been included at the \\nend of the notebook pages and you are expected to have all In-Lab activities completed in your lab notebook before \\nleaving lab. Please note that points may be deducted from your notebook score and lab performance points if you are \\nunable to complete these lab activities due to tardiness or lateness. You can read more about lab performance points \\nbelow.  \\n \\nALL entries in your lab notebook  (or lab manual when applicable) should be recorded in Blue or Black pen  when \\nusing either a digital or physical copy of the notebook. No white-outs or highlighters allowed to be used in the lab \\nnotebook. Lab notebook guidelines are described in the ‘Guide for Success in the General Chemistry Laboratory’ \\nsection of your laboratory manual (beginning on page xiii) . To protect your electronic device from chemical \\ncontamination, students should place their device in a plastic bag during lab. You will be provided with one bag at the \\nbeginning of the semester. Please do not discard this bag since a replacement bag will not be provided. You may \\nchoose to use an electronic writing utensil such as an Apple Pencil or stylus in lab at your own risk. Please note that \\nwe will not provide a protective barrier for them as we do for your iPads/tablets. If your electronic writing utensil should \\nbecome chemically contaminated, it must be disposed of as hazardous waste and will not be replaced. \\n \\nFor all in-person labs, a digital copy of your filled-in lab notebook should be submitted to Carmen within 48 hours after \\nthe start time of your in-person lab. You can submit your digital copy in one of two ways: \\n 1) a PDF exported from Notability or a similar app. \\n 2) Scans/photos of physical notebooks. \\n \\nSpecific instructions for your notebook upload can be found in the relevant Carmen upload assignment. \\n \\nPlease note the following about your Notebook Uploads. \\n• The only accepted file types for submitting digital copies of notebook pages are docx and PDF.  \\n• You must use the following file naming system:  lastname.#_firstname_semester&year_experimentcode. \\nFor example, a lab notebook upload for experiment MSR in Autumn 2025 would have the file name \\n“Smith.1234_John_AU25_MSR”. \\n• Incorrect file name format will result in points deductions. An exception to the point deduction is the \\nnotebook upload assignment for experiment WRM, the Check-In lab. \\n \\nPlease submit only a single file. All provided notebook pages containing the purpose, procedure citation, procedure, \\ndata to collect and in-lab activity must be in the same file. Be sure to open your notebook in Carmen after submission \\nto ensure that all the pages have been fully submitted.  Unfortunately, if you do not submit a digital copy of your lab \\nnotebook on time, your TA will not be able to grade your Post-Lab assignment and you will not receive the 15 notebook \\npoints for the lab in question. If a digital copy of your notebook, with all procedure and data included, is not received \\nbefore the final deadline for lab work (Tuesday, December 9 th), you will only  earn your performance and/or \\nparticipation points for your Post-Lab. \\nPlease note that for each specific experiment, you can still submit your lab notebook after the 48-hour window for a \\n5-point deduction unless the final deadline has passed.  Also, note that students cannot be excused from notebook \\nuploads of experiments that have been assigned to them. \\n \\nOnly pdf and docx submissions on Carmen will be accepted for lab notebooks. Submissions only containing links to \\nOneDrive, etc. folders, submissions via email, and submissions via comments in Carmen will not be accepted. Please \\nmake sure you submit your notebook pages to the correct assignment dropbox in Carmen. Turning in notebook pages \\nto the wrong assignment dropbox will result in no credit for the notebook or the corresponding LabRight Post-Lab \\nonce the final deadline to submit labs has passed on Tuesday, December 9th 2025. If you submit  your notebook  \\n                                               AUTUMN 2025  \\n9 \\n \\npages for any experiment within a week of the final deadline, please contact your lab TA and notify them of your \\nsubmission in order for them to grade your LabRight Post-Lab for that experiment. \\n \\nWe encourage you to review your notebook pages  in Carmen after your submission to ensure you have submitted \\nwhat you intend to submit for that assignment. We can only accept the work you submit to the appropriate assignment \\nin Carmen. \\n \\nPlease do not re-upload your notebook pages once they have been graded with the intention of getting a higher score \\nunless a file exception has been made, as described below. Since notebooks uploaded after the 48-hour submission \\nwindow are considered late, re-uploading your notebook pages will result in your notebook grade being reduced by 5 \\npoints as a result of a late submission. \\nNotebook File Exception: For instances where submission requirements are not  met, students will be given one \\nexception to resubmit their notebook pages for one experiment in order to have the new pages regraded. If you want \\nto use your exception, you must contact the lab supervisors within a week of your  assignment being graded. If your \\nrequest for file exception is approved, we will waive the policy that prevents you from resubmitting your work for a \\nbetter grade. If the lab supervisor grants a file except ion, you must send the file to them within 48 hours  of \\nthem approving the file exception. Conditions under which an exception will be granted are: \\n• Submitting the notebook pages for a different experiment \\n• Submitting the appropriate notebook pages to a different notebook assignment \\n• Naming the file incorrectly \\n• Accidentally submitting a blank file or missing any pages in the initial submission \\n• Correcting any formatting errors \\n• Request for a late penalty on notebook to be waived. \\n• Extenuating circumstances as determined by the lab supervisors \\n \\n \\nPlease note that when a file exception is made, you cannot change the data in your previously uploaded notebook . \\nChanging the data will put you in jeopardy of violating our data integrity policy. Additional instances that do not qualify \\nfor an exception include but are not limited to forgetting to submit the notebook assignment or submitting notebook \\npages completed from a previous semester. \\n \\nLABORATORY PERFORMANCE  AND PARTICIPATION : To foster a safe and positive learning \\nenvironment for all students, each in- person laboratory grade includes 5 points for laboratory performance. In the \\nbullet points below, we discuss some of the items that contribute to your performance points. \\n• To make sure you (and your lab partner) complete lab in time, we highly encourage you to arrive outside the \\nlaboratory before the official start time and wait for the TA to welcome you into the lab room. Arriving after the \\nstart time of your lab can result in points deduction.  \\n• You are expected to be prepared. Proper attire must be worn, and safety policies must be followed; see page \\n11 and the Safety Statement on Carmen for more information. \\n• As the laboratory is a common space, you are expected to treat all equipment respectfully and use it properly. \\n• You must follow instructions given in the lab manual and by your TA, and if a mistake is made, adjust your \\ntechnique or behavior to adhere to these instructions.  \\n• Cell phones must be put away in a backpack or bag during lab . Laptops and tablets should never be set \\ndirectly on the lab bench (due to chemical contamination) before cleaning. Headphone use is strictly prohibited. \\n• Gloves must be taken off before leaving the lab room. Please do not touch the doorknobs or any food or drink \\nitems while wearing gloves. \\n• You are expected to complete any in-lab activities before leaving lab unless extenuating circumstances apply. \\n• Y ou must start cleaning up 15 mins before the end of your lab time. \\n• Make sure your TA checks you out before you leave the lab. \\n \\nEvery student will begin each lab period with all 5 performance points. Your TA will deduct points for not following the \\nabove guidelines. “Lab Performance and Participation” is a separate assignment in Carmen for each in- person lab. \\nAfter each lab, your TA will assign you performance and participation points; you do not need to complete this \\nassignment in Carmen. \\n \\nPlease note that students who are continuously late to lab will be asked to meet with the lab supervisors to chat about \\nthe recurring lateness first before they can continue working in the lab.  \\n                                               AUTUMN 2025  \\n10 \\n \\nLABRIGHT POST-LABS:  Post-Labs, available on LabRight, will be completed after most experiments and will \\ncontain Data Analysis sections for applicable experiments. You can only access the Post-Labs through Carmen.  \\nOnly have the Post-Lab open when you are working on it. If the Post -Lab has been idle for more than an hour, quit \\nand save your work, and re- open the link from Carmen. Never open more than one Post -Lab at a time, and never \\nopen multiple Post -Labs in multiple tabs or browsers simultaneously. The data integrity policies listed in the \\nPresentation of Data section apply to the data submitted in the LabRight Post-Lab.  \\n \\nYou can only submit each Post-Lab once; they will not be reset for any reason. However, you can attempt each Post-\\nLab question twice. After answering a Post-Lab question, you may click on the \"How Did I Do?\" button at the top of \\nthe question to see which answers are incorrect. You can then review the relevant topics and revise your response(s). \\nYour revised response(s) will not be graded until you submit the completed Post -Lab by clicking the \"Submit \\nAssignment\" button.  \\n \\nPost-Labs are due one week after the completion of the experiment by the start time of your lab period. If the due date \\nof a Post-Lab coincides with a University Holiday, an extension will be applied to that assignment.  Please note that \\nthe due dates will not be extended beyond the final deadline i.e. Tuesday, December 9th 2025. \\nData Analysis Section in Post-Labs : Your Post-Lab assessments for experiments MSR, PbI, LLT, IHT, and \\nGAS include Data Analysis sections that you will use to analyze the data you collected. For these sections, you will \\nreceive targeted feedback as you work up your data. When entering numerical values in a Post-Lab, unless otherwise \\nindicated, be sure to follow  the Significant Figure rules outlined in Appendix  D of this lab manual. See the General \\nInformation below to learn about the LabRight platform.   \\n  \\nStudents cannot be excused from Post -Labs and Data Analysis Worksheet that have been assigned to them. Only \\nhave the assignments open when you are working on it. Failure to purchase access will result in forfeiture of these \\npoints. Only performance/participation points will be given to Post-labs submitted after 3 days past the due date. Note: \\nThe lab notebook needs to be submitted in order to receive any credit for the Post -labs. Even if 3 days have not \\nelapsed, assignments will not be accepted after Tuesday, December 9\\nth 2025 at 11:59 pm. \\n \\nLABORATORY POLICIES \\n \\nSUPPLEMENTARY DATA POLICY: If you are unable to collect all the data needed in lab, you should email the \\nlab supervisors within 24 hours of the start of lab. The lab supervisors will review your circumstance and make a \\ndecision as to whether you will be provided with supplementary data to replace the data that was not collected. \\nDepending on the type of data you need, points may be deducted from your Presentation of Data and/or procedure \\nquestions in the Post-Lab. Please note that contacting the lab supervisors is not an assurance that you will receive \\ndata. \\nMISSED LABORATORY POLICY: To ensure a successful and productive lab experience, students are required \\nto attend all labs this semester. Students will be allowed to make- up one lab per semester for any reason. No \\ndocumentation is required to obtain this make- up lab, but the lab supervisors must be notified of the request for a \\nmake-up within 1 week of the missed lab date. These make-up sessions will take place at the same time as your \\nregularly scheduled lab session on the corresponding day and time of your lab on the week of December 1st \\nto December 5 th. The make- up lab cannot be rescheduled for any reason and students are not allowed to \\nattend different lab sessions to complete their make-up lab. \\n  \\nRequests for no more than ONE additional make-up lab will be considered and may be approved with no additional \\npenalty in the case of specific university-approved absences (see below). If a second make-up lab is approved without \\na university approved absence, a 40-point penalty will be applied to the final lab grade. The 40-point grade penalty is \\napplied in a separate column in the Carmen grade book so students can easily see when a grade penalty is applied. \\nIf you are approved for a make-up lab for a second missed lab, the make-up will be a digital alternate version of the \\nin-person lab you missed.  No additional lab absences will be allowed, except in cases of significant extenuating \\ncircumstances. In such cases, the lab supervisors may review the reasons for the first two missed labs when \\nconsidering the circumstances of a third missed lab. \\n  \\n                                               AUTUMN 2025  \\n11 \\n \\nUnfortunately, the 40-point penalty cannot be waived for the following reasons: Lack of preparation, negligence, work \\nschedules, planned vacations, failure to have proper PPE (goggles and Lab coat) and/or lab attire, and exams held \\nduring regularly scheduled lab sessions.  \\n \\nThe 40- point penalty will be waived for the following reasons with proper documentation: Student -athlete \\ncommitments, military commitments, religious obligations, medical emergencies, illness (including COVID-19), death \\nof a family member, childcare issues, or SLDS attendance/deadline modifications. The lab supervisors may request \\nsome form of documentation to have the 40- point penalty waived. Please  be sure to email the requested \\ndocumentation to the email listed at the front of the syllabus within 1 week of the missed lab. Documents sent after \\none week of the lab may not be considered for removing the 40-point penalty. If you’ll miss a lab due to religious \\nobligations, you must email the lab supervisors by 11:59 PM on Tuesday, September 9th. For more information on \\naccommodations for religious observances, refer to the General Course Information on page 2 of this lab syllabus.  \\n \\nIf you miss an in-person lab and want to request make-up, you should email the Lab Supervisors within one week of \\nthe missed lab. Students assigned to the end of semester make- up will complete it during their regularly scheduled \\nlab time during the make-up week from December 1st to December 5th  and the make-up cannot be rescheduled. \\nThis make-up lab will be unrelated to the lab you missed. \\n \\nIf you are registered with SLDS with Intermittent Flex Plan, please refer to the Intermittent Flex Plan Agreement in \\nyour Carmen course for specific policies about missed labs. \\n \\nIf you do not attend the lab, please do NOT submit a Post-Lab. If you do not contact the lab supervisors within a week \\nof an in-person missed lab and submit the in- person Post-Lab for that experiment, you will automatically receive a \\nzero on the assignments, including the notebook upload, and will forfeit the opportunity for a make-up assignment for \\nthat experiment. \\nLATE ENROLLMENT: Please note that i f you enrolled in Chem 1210 once the semester begins, you are \\nresponsible for ensuring that you did not miss any lab assignments. We strongly suggest that you check the Laboratory \\nModules in Carmen and note any assignments you may have missed due to your late enrollment. Then reach out to \\nthe lab supervisors within one week of your enrollment in the class to request make-ups for any lab assignments you \\nhave missed. \\nINCOMPLETE POLICY : While nobody begins the semester anticipating they will receive an incomplete for a \\ncourse, there are circumstances that may warrant that a student takes an incomplete in the course. In such situations, \\nthe Incomplete Policy for General Chemistry Lab will allow you to make-up a maximum of four (4) experiments. All \\nincomplete requests must be made in writing to the lab supervisors  by Tuesday, December 9th  at  11:59 pm. \\nRequests made after the final deadline will only be approved in the case of significant extenuating circumstances. \\n \\nHEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS \\n \\nMEDICAL INSURANCE COVERAGE:  Due to the potentially dangerous nature of laboratory work, you are \\nrequired to maintain medical insurance coverage through the Ohio State student health insurance or a private agency \\nwhen enrolling in chemistry laboratory courses. \\nLAB ROOM SANITIZATION: Students will be required to sanitize all equipment and glassware using the supplied \\n70% ethanol used before leaving lab. Cleaning and sanitizing are part of our regular standard operating procedures \\nthat have been approved by the University’s Department of Environmental Health and Safety. Failure to clean and \\nsanitize your equipment and glassware will result in loss of performance points for the experiment of the day. \\n \\nLABORATORY SAFETY REQUIREMENTS : Students are required to read, understand, and implement the \\nsafety precautions indicated in the laboratory manual. The precautions are summarized on a safety statement which \\nmust be digitally signed on Carmen by all students during their first laboratory period.  Until this statement is signed, \\nstudents are not permitted to participate in laboratory activities. Some particularly important parts are: \\n \\n1. You must wear department-authorized ANSI code goggles in the laboratory. If your goggles are lost, a new pair \\nmust be purchased from 180 Celeste Lab. Students in the lab without goggles will incur a 5-point deduction from \\ntheir lab performance & participation. Continued violations will result in a more severe point penalty and may \\nresult in dismissal from the course. Wearing contact lenses is not recommended.  \\n2. According to University policy, wearing a face covering in lab is optional (https://safeandhealthy.osu.edu/personal-\\nprotection-hygiene). Students will need to provide their own face mask if they opt to wear a mask. We recommend  \\n                                               AUTUMN 2025  \\n12 \\n \\nbringing a second mask to change into after the lab is complete. You should wash any reusable face covering \\nthat you wore in lab before wearing again. Please note in the unlikely event your face covering is contaminated \\nby a spill or splash, it may need to be disposed of as hazardous waste. In that case, you will be provided with a \\ndisposable mask to complete the day’s lab. \\n3. Each student must wear adequate clothing to reduce the possibility of injury from chemicals or broken glass, \\nincluding long pants and shoes that cover your entire foot. Students wearing inappropriate attire - including \\nbut not limited to shorts, sandals, slippers, spandex or other thin, skin-tight pants, pants with holes, tank \\ntops, or short skirts , leggings - will be sent home.  These students are expected to change and return to \\ncomplete the experiment in proper attire. Confine long hair. Your ankles should be completely covered.  Please \\nnote that this policy is to protect you from chemical burns or spills. \\n4. When in lab all students must wear closed- toe shoes with a high back or closed- heel. The back or heel of the \\nshoe should measure at least 2 inches from the top of the sole of the shoe or where your heel rests. As a \\nguideline, 2 inches is approximately 3 finger widths. The heel of the shoe should accommodate at least  three \\nfingers when measured starting from the sole.  Your foot should also be secure in the shoe and should not slip \\nout while walking or moving around the lab space. For further clarification, refer to question Q11 of the Safety & \\nLab Policies Quiz. Please do not wear shoes that you might trip in. \\n5. Familiarize yourself with the location of the fire extinguisher and eye wash in the laboratory.   \\n6. Promptly report all accidents, no matter how small, to your lab instructor. \\n7. Your work area and common glassware must be cleaned before you leave the lab. After cleaning all glassware, \\nyou must sanitize your glassware with the provided 70% ethanol solution. Once you have sanitized all glassware, \\nclean your bench with the provided 70% ethanol.  This ensures that you, and other students who use the space, \\nwill have a clean and sanitized workstation. Clean up spills in the balance room by brushing chemicals into a \\nweighing dish.   \\n8. No unauthorized experiments are allowed. No chemicals may be removed from the lab.  \\n \\n \\n \\nRequirements in this syllabus (assignments, due dates, policies etc.) may be altered ONLY by a Lab \\nSupervisor or the Vice Chair for Undergraduate Studies. Please see the lecture syllabus for pre-\\nrequisites, goals and learning outcomes, commitment to diversity, and details about recitation, online \\nhomework, and exams. All lecture policies still apply to the laboratory. \\nSTANDARDS OF ACADEMIC CONDUCT IN GENERAL CHEMISTRY LAB \\n \\nSTUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES: Any graded material submitted in General Chemistry must represent your own \\nwork. This includes exams, quizzes, homework, and laboratory assignments, which are to be an individual effort. \\nUnauthorized group efforts by students, use of another student’s course materials, or assistance from individuals who \\nalready have taken the course, could place you in jeopardy of violation of the standards for General Chemistry. In \\nsome courses, group work is acceptable on certain activities (as explicitly stated by your instructor). In these cases, it \\nis important that you know and understand where authorized collaboration (working in a group) ends and collusion \\n(working together in an unauthorized manner) begins. Identical answers indicate copying or unacceptable group \\nefforts - always answer questions in your own unique words. It is important that you consult with your instructor for \\nclarification on whether or not collaboration is appropriate on an activity. \\n \\nYou should not assist others in violating academic standards. Students supplying materials for others to \"look at\" may \\nbe charged with academic misconduct. Never allow another student access to your P re-Laboratory exercises, lab \\nreports, or other assignments – even after completion of the course. \"I didn\\'t know they were going to copy my work\" \\nis not an acceptable excuse.  \\nLaboratory: Laboratory work is the essence of the science of chemistry. You are expected to perform all parts of the \\nexperiments with your own equipment, chemicals, and unknowns. The accumulation of data, calculations derived from \\nthat data, and any conclusions or answers to questions associated with that experiment are to be your own work. \\nAcademic misconduct involving lab work includes but is not limited to the following: \\n• Laboratory data may not be altered or \"made up. All laboratory work must be done in your assigned laboratory \\nroom, during your scheduled time period, and under the supervision of your assigned teaching assistant.  \\n• Plagiarism or the submission of work based on old material is considered to be academic misconduct no \\nmatter how small the infraction. Possession of another student’s lab report(s) will raise immediate concerns \\nabout academic misconduct.     \\n• Evidence of copying or unauthorized \"working together\" on laboratory course work will be submitted to COAM. \\n• Individuals retaking the course must complete all work for the course during the current semester, and may \\nnot submit any parts of any laboratory assignment from a previous semester (see item #6 in “Ten Suggestions \\nfor Preserving Academic Integrity”, http://oaa.osu.edu/coamtensuggestions.html\\n).  \\n                                               AUTUMN 2025  \\n13 \\n \\n• If you are found in violation, COAM will decide what disciplinary and/or grade sanctions you receive. Additional \\ninformation about COAM policies and procedures can be found at https://oaa.osu.edu/academic-integrity-and-\\nmisconduct. \\n \\nCONCLUSION \\n \\nWe are going to have a great semester learning and experimenting together. We know this syllabus is a lot of \\ninformation to digest at once but remember that the lab team is there to guide you when you have questions. You can \\nfind out more about us and the other General Chemistry team members  on the “Contacts” page in Carmen, and to \\nfind which one of us has the specific expertise to address your unique needs. We cannot wait to meet you! ')]"
