Ensure services are provided efficiently\\nwith a focus on customer service while also ensuring compliance.\\n22) Using robust reporting tools and data analysis, ensure unit and college leadership has\\nfinancial and human resources data to inform strategic decisions.College of Engineering Strategic Plan May 16, 2018 \\n4 \\nBackground and current conditions \\nFrom automobiles to spaceships, cities to computers, the modern world’s built environment, and \\nits constructive interaction in a sustainable way with the world’s natural environment, are the \\nresult of generations of research, applications, and work by countless architects and engineers.  \\nThe current breadth of The Ohio State University’s College of Engineering and Knowlton \\nSchool of Architecture reflects this essential role our expertise has provided to nearly every facet \\nof modern society.  This current strategic plan articulates our proposed path forward, to continue \\nthis critical contribution to society, here in Ohio and across the globe.  We seek to pursue this \\npath in order to maintain the cutting-edge leadership of The Ohio State University in the \\ndevelopment of positive social, economic, educational, and quality of life outcomes for all \\npeople everywhere. \\nFurthermore, the ability of  The Ohio State University’s College of Engineering and Knowlton \\nSchool of Architecture to continue their leadership roles depends as much on the constructive \\nintegration of multiple and disparate disciplines, as it does on the strength of any of these \\nindividual disciplines themselves.  Therefore, in addition to a plan that fortifies traditional core-\\nstrengths (e.g., “mechanical engineering,” “chemical engineering,” or “optical engineering”), this \\nplan also brings strong focus to the interdisciplinary nature of the work required to contribute \\nbeneficially to modern society.  The strength of connectivity among disciplines is required as a \\nresult of the deeper integration of the world itself, made possible through advancements in \\ninformation technology, communications, transportation, supply chains, and many other \\nengineering and architecture-related activities. \\nThe following additional factors are high-level drivers that have shaped the current strategic \\nplan.  \\nMeeting the demand for engineers. Sustainable growth and increased standards of living for \\nour global society requires high quality, work place- and market place-ready engineering and \\narchitecture talent be produced in significant quantity. As a result, the national and global \\ndemand for engineering and architecture talent continues to increase. At the same time, the \\ncollege-age population in the U.S. is decreasing. The higher education market place is becoming \\nincreasingly competitive and engineering programs must deepen the quality of the academic \\nprogramming, faculty, facilities and infrastructure and open access to new pools of incoming \\nstudents.  \\nFaculty Growth. To assure high quality education and robust research, we are growing our \\nfaculty to 340 tenure track faculty members and 60 clinical faculty members by 2021. This \\ncampaign is being supported by investments in associated faculty, staff, graduate students and \\nfacilities.  \\nGlobalization of engineering. Engineering and architecture are international endeavors. Our \\nstudents must be prepared for the international dimension of the profession they are training for.  \\nDiversity and inclusion. Diversity in culture, ethnicity and background and inclusion of all \\nperspectives is essential to ensure maximum effectiveness and health of the engineering and College of Engineering Strategic Plan  May 16, 2018 \\n  \\n5 \\narchitecture professions. Diverse and inclusive environments where teaching and research occurs \\nis essential to ensure that the knowledge created and the students produced are relevant and \\nconnected to the needs of our changing global society.  \\n \\nDistinguishing areas of research strength. While continuing to build the Ohio State brand in \\nour recognized strengths in Materials, Manufacturing, Mobility and Engineering for Medicine \\n(4M’s), we will strategically invest in areas that directly address what matters most to the State \\nof Ohio, the Nation and the Global community. Ohio State’s recognized capabilities in the 4M’s \\ndifferentiate us from other universities and allows us to capitalize on our asymmetric advantages \\nin these areas. To enhance our state, national, and global impact, we will also foster and expand \\nour network of collaborators and customers in the key research areas and industries, including: \\nenergy, transportation, aerospace, automotive, manufacturing, medical devices, defense, \\ncybersecurity, robotics, data analytics, and water and environmental management. \\nNew modes of teaching and learning. The centuries-old model for creating learning \\ncommunities by aggregating teachers and learners in the same place at the same time is now \\nbeing extended in our massively connected electronic world. High-bandwidth communications, \\ndata storage and rendering that span the globe allow us to port the traditional classroom \\nexperience across distance and time. This enables us to reach new kinds of students and develop \\neducational programs that go far beyond traditional degree programs.  \\n \\nSupporting expanded undergraduate degree programs. Undergraduate enrollment has \\nincreased by over 60% since 2008. This growth has placed significant demands on faculty, staff, \\nspace and fiscal resources. The college has not yet fully adapted to this growth and elements \\nsupporting undergraduate educational programs must be reinforced and modified.  \\nDispersed location. The college operates on main campus, west campus locations, the OSU \\nAirport and the Transportation Research Center. It must develop the methods and culture to \\noperate effectively across these physical separations.  \\n \\nCommunication. Efficient communication across the large and dispersed organization has \\nnatural challenges. Reliable channels of communication, electronic connectivity, and electronic \\nworkflow must be developed, refined and used regularly to ensure efficiency and effectiveness.  \\n \\nFocus. The profile of the college has increased in recent years. The range of opportunities for the \\ncollege has increased accordingly. A solid strategy, well-conceived, broadly adopted and closely \\nfollowed is needed to know which opportunities to pursue and which to let pass \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n College of Engineering Strategic Plan  May 16, 2018 \\n  \\n6 \\nResearch \\n \\nGoal: Provide scientific and technological leadership in the 4M’s, and across the 4M’s, \\naddressing successfully the biggest challenges for the State of Ohio, the Nation, and the \\nWorld through collaborative solutions. \\nStrategy Metric \\nMake strategic investments in faculty, researchers, \\ngraduate students, equipment and space to grow \\ncapability of major interdisciplinary research centers \\naligned with signature research in the 4M’s. \\n\\uf0b7 5 major College Centers with \\ngreater than $5M/yr. external \\nfunding. \\nPromote interdisciplinarity through joint faculty \\nappointments and establishing formalized partnerships \\nwith other colleges at OSU that focus on major cost \\nsharing investments in infrastructure, technology and \\nfaculty support. \\n\\uf0b7 20% joint appointment faculty. \\n\\uf0b7 Establish 3 new inter-college \\nresearch facilities by FY20. \\nConsolidate research and operations best practices \\ndeveloped by the COE research centers, and create a \\nframework for all COE units to accomplish more \\nstreamlined operations.  \\n\\uf0b7 Reduction in processing time, \\nsimpler logistics, more nimble \\noperations. \\nUtilize the Proposal Development Office and COE‘s \\nresearch expertise to capture major research programs \\naligned with signature research areas, and grow the size \\nand the scope of the Proposal Development Office to \\nincrease the faculty’s effectiveness in securing external \\nresearch funding. \\n\\uf0b7 10% increase in the number of \\nmajor research awards \\n(>$1M/yr) \\n\\uf0b7 Total annual research \\nexpenditures of $160M by \\nFY20. \\n\\uf0b7 Annual research expenditures \\nper faculty member of \\n$500K/TTF by FY20. \\nCapitalize on the OSU’s Corporate Engagement Office \\nand the Industry Liaison Office to connect industry \\nfunded research with Federal and State programs. \\n\\uf0b7  Secure $20-40M in new \\nopportunities with industry \\ncollaboration. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nGoal: Invest in engaged scholarship, and grow the impact and reputation of the College’s \\nresearch, translational and education programs.
